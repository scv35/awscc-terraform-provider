<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Read-Only

- `customer_gateway_id` (String) The ID of the customer gateway at your end of the VPN connection.
- `enable_acceleration` (Boolean)
- `static_routes_only` (Boolean) Indicates whether the VPN connection uses static routes only. Static routes must be used for devices that don't support BGP.
 If you are creating a VPN connection for a device that does not support Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), you must specify ``true``.
- `tags` (Attributes List) Any tags assigned to the VPN connection. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))
- `transit_gateway_id` (String) The ID of the transit gateway associated with the VPN connection.
 You must specify either ``TransitGatewayId`` or ``VpnGatewayId``, but not both.
- `type` (String) The type of VPN connection.
- `vpn_connection_id` (String)
- `vpn_gateway_id` (String) The ID of the virtual private gateway at the AWS side of the VPN connection.
 You must specify either ``TransitGatewayId`` or ``VpnGatewayId``, but not both.
- `vpn_tunnel_options_specifications` (Attributes List) The tunnel options for the VPN connection. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--vpn_tunnel_options_specifications))
