## Schema

### Optional

- `observability_configuration_name` (String) A name for the observability configuration. When you use it for the first time in an AWS Region, App Runner creates revision number 1 of this name. When you use the same name in subsequent calls, App Runner creates incremental revisions of the configuration.
- `tags` (Attributes List) A list of metadata items that you can associate with your observability configuration resource. A tag is a key-value pair. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))
- `trace_configuration` (Attributes) The configuration of the tracing feature within this observability configuration. If you don't specify it, App Runner doesn't enable tracing. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--trace_configuration))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `latest` (Boolean) It's set to true for the configuration with the highest Revision among all configurations that share the same Name. It's set to false otherwise.
- `observability_configuration_arn` (String) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this ObservabilityConfiguration
- `observability_configuration_revision` (Number) The revision of this observability configuration. It's unique among all the active configurations ('Status': 'ACTIVE') that share the same ObservabilityConfigurationName.
