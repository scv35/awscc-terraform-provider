# awscc_ec2_vpn_connection (Resource)

Specifies a VPN connection between a virtual private gateway and a VPN customer gateway or a transit gateway and a VPN customer gateway.
 To specify a VPN connection between a transit gateway and customer gateway, use the ``TransitGatewayId`` and ``CustomerGatewayId`` properties.
 To specify a VPN connection between a virtual private gateway and customer gateway, use the ``VpnGatewayId`` and ``CustomerGatewayId`` properties.
 For more information, see [](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html) in the *User Guide*.

## Example Usage

### Transit Gateway
VPN connection attached to a Transit Gateway.
```terraform
resource "awscc_ec2_transit_gateway" "example" {}

resource "awscc_ec2_customer_gateway" "example" {
  bgp_asn    = 65000
  ip_address = "198.51.100.1"
  type       = "ipsec.1"
}

resource "awscc_ec2_vpn_connection" "example" {
  customer_gateway_id = awscc_ec2_customer_gateway.example.id
  transit_gateway_id  = awscc_ec2_transit_gateway.example.id
  type                = "ipsec.1"

  vpn_tunnel_options_specifications = [{
    tunnel_inside_cidr = "169.254.10.0/30"
    pre_shared_key     = "example1"
    },
    {
      tunnel_inside_cidr = "169.254.11.0/30"
      pre_shared_key     = "example2"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Virtual Private Gateway
VPN connection to a Virtual Private Gateway.
```terraform
resource "awscc_ec2_vpn_gateway" "example" {
  type = "ipsec.1"
}

resource "awscc_ec2_customer_gateway" "example" {
  bgp_asn    = 65000
  ip_address = "198.51.100.1"
  type       = "ipsec.1"
}

resource "awscc_ec2_vpn_connection" "example" {
  customer_gateway_id = awscc_ec2_customer_gateway.example.id
  vpn_gateway_id      = awscc_ec2_vpn_gateway.example.id
  type                = "ipsec.1"

  vpn_tunnel_options_specifications = [{
    tunnel_inside_cidr = "169.254.10.0/30"
    pre_shared_key     = "example1"

    },
    {
      tunnel_inside_cidr = "169.254.11.0/30"
      pre_shared_key     = "example2"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `customer_gateway_id` (String) The ID of the customer gateway at your end of the VPN connection.
- `type` (String) The type of VPN connection.

### Optional

- `enable_acceleration` (Boolean)
- `static_routes_only` (Boolean) Indicates whether the VPN connection uses static routes only. Static routes must be used for devices that don't support BGP.
 If you are creating a VPN connection for a device that does not support Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), you must specify ``true``.
- `tags` (Attributes List) Any tags assigned to the VPN connection. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))
- `transit_gateway_id` (String) The ID of the transit gateway associated with the VPN connection.
 You must specify either ``TransitGatewayId`` or ``VpnGatewayId``, but not both.
- `vpn_gateway_id` (String) The ID of the virtual private gateway at the AWS side of the VPN connection.
 You must specify either ``TransitGatewayId`` or ``VpnGatewayId``, but not both.
- `vpn_tunnel_options_specifications` (Attributes List) The tunnel options for the VPN connection. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--vpn_tunnel_options_specifications))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `vpn_connection_id` (String)

<a id="nestedatt--tags"></a>
### Nested Schema for `tags`

Required:

- `key` (String) The tag key.
- `value` (String) The tag value.


<a id="nestedatt--vpn_tunnel_options_specifications"></a>
### Nested Schema for `vpn_tunnel_options_specifications`

Optional:

- `pre_shared_key` (String) The pre-shared key (PSK) to establish initial authentication between the virtual private gateway and customer gateway.
 Constraints: Allowed characters are alphanumeric characters, periods (.), and underscores (_). Must be between 8 and 64 characters in length and cannot start with zero (0).
- `tunnel_inside_cidr` (String) The range of inside IP addresses for the tunnel. Any specified CIDR blocks must be unique across all VPN connections that use the same virtual private gateway. 
 Constraints: A size /30 CIDR block from the ``169.254.0.0/16`` range. The following CIDR blocks are reserved and cannot be used:
  +   ``169.254.0.0/30`` 
  +   ``169.254.1.0/30`` 
  +   ``169.254.2.0/30`` 
  +   ``169.254.3.0/30`` 
  +   ``169.254.4.0/30`` 
  +   ``169.254.5.0/30`` 
  +   ``169.254.169.252/30``

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:
