# awscc_ce_anomaly_monitor (Resource)

AWS Cost Anomaly Detection leverages advanced Machine Learning technologies to identify anomalous spend and root causes, so you can quickly take action. You can use Cost Anomaly Detection by creating monitor.

## Example Usage

### AWS Cost Anomaly Monitor by Service

Creates a dimensional cost anomaly monitor that tracks AWS cost anomalies at the service level, helping to identify unusual spending patterns across AWS services.

~> This example is generated by LLM using Amazon Bedrock and validated using terraform validate, apply and destroy. While we strive for accuracy and quality, please note that the information provided may not be entirely error-free or up-to-date. We recommend independently verifying the content.

```terraform
# Create cost anomaly monitor for AWS cost
resource "awscc_ce_anomaly_monitor" "cost_monitor" {
  monitor_name = "aws-cost-monitor"
  monitor_type = "DIMENSIONAL"
  monitor_specification = jsonencode({
    dimensions = {
      key = "SERVICE"
    }
  })

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}
```
