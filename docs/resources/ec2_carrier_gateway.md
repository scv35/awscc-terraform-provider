# awscc_ec2_carrier_gateway (Resource)

An example resource schema demonstrating some basic constructs and validation rules.

## Example Usage

### Create Carrier Gateway with VPC

To create an AWS Carrier Gateway, this example demonstrates the setup of a carrier gateway attached to a new VPC with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16.

~> This example is generated by LLM using Amazon Bedrock and validated using terraform validate, apply and destroy. While we strive for accuracy and quality, please note that the information provided may not be entirely error-free or up-to-date. We recommend independently verifying the content.

```terraform
# Get current AWS account information
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

# Get current AWS region
data "aws_region" "current" {}

# Create a VPC for the carrier gateway
resource "awscc_ec2_vpc" "example" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}

# Create the carrier gateway
resource "awscc_ec2_carrier_gateway" "example" {
  vpc_id = awscc_ec2_vpc.example.id
  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}
```
