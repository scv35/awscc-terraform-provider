```terraform
# Get current region
data "aws_region" "current" {}

# Get current account ID
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

# Create CodeDeploy Application
resource "awscc_codedeploy_application" "example" {
  application_name = "example-application"
  compute_platform = "Server" # Valid values: Server, Lambda, or ECS

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"

## Schema

### Optional

- `application_name` (String) A name for the application. If you don't specify a name, AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the application name.
- `compute_platform` (String) The compute platform that CodeDeploy deploys the application to.
- `tags` (Attributes List) The metadata that you apply to CodeDeploy applications to help you organize and categorize them. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

<a id="nestedatt--tags"></a>
### Nested Schema for `tags`

Optional:

- `key` (String)
- `value` (String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:
