Note: this example is generated by LLM using Amazon Bedrock and validated using terraform validate, apply and destroy. While we strive for accuracy and quality, please note that the information provided may not be entirely error-free or up-to-date. We recommend independently verifying the content.

```terraform
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}
data "aws_region" "current" {}

# Create an Amazon Connect instance first
resource "awscc_connect_instance" "example" {
  attributes = {
    inbound_calls  = true
    outbound_calls = true
  }
  identity_management_type = "CONNECT_MANAGED"
  instance_alias           = "example-security-profile-instance"
  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}

# Create the security profile
resource "awscc_connect_security_profile" "example" {
  instance_arn          = awscc_connect_instance.example.arn
  security_profile_name = "example-security-profile"
  description           = "Example security profile created via AWSCC"

  permissions = [
    "BasicAgentAccess",
    "OutboundCallAccess"
  ]

  applications = [{
    namespace               = "Connect"
    application_permissions = ["AccessAgentApplication"]
  }]

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
