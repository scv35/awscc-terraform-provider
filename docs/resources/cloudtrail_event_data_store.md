Both InsightSelectors and InsightsDestination need to have a value in order to enable Insights events on an event data store. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--insight_selectors))
- `insights_destination` (String) Specifies the ARN of the event data store that will collect Insights events. Both InsightSelectors and InsightsDestination need to have a value in order to enable Insights events on an event data store
- `kms_key_id` (String) Specifies the KMS key ID to use to encrypt the events delivered by CloudTrail. The value can be an alias name prefixed by 'alias/', a fully specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or a globally unique identifier.
- `multi_region_enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether the event data store includes events from all regions, or only from the region in which it was created.
- `name` (String) The name of the event data store.
- `organization_enabled` (Boolean) Indicates that an event data store is collecting logged events for an organization.
- `retention_period` (Number) The retention period, in days.
