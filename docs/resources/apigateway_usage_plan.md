# awscc_apigateway_usage_plan (Resource)

The ``AWS::ApiGateway::UsagePlan`` resource creates a usage plan for deployed APIs. A usage plan sets a target for the throttling and quota limits on individual client API keys. For more information, see [Creating and Using API Usage Plans in Amazon API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-api-usage-plans.html) in the *API Gateway Developer Guide*.
 In some cases clients can exceed the targets that you set. Don?t rely on usage plans to control costs.

- `offset` (Number) The number of requests subtracted from the given limit in the initial time period.
- `period` (String) The time period in which the limit applies. Valid values are "DAY", "WEEK" or "MONTH".


<a id="nestedatt--tags"></a>
### Nested Schema for `tags`

Required:

- `key` (String) The key name of the tag. You can specify a value that is 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length and cannot be prefixed with aws:. You can use any of the following characters: the set of Unicode letters, digits, whitespace, _, ., /, =, +, and -.
- `value` (String) The value for the tag. You can specify a value that is 0 to 256 Unicode characters in length and cannot be prefixed with aws:. You can use any of the following characters: the set of Unicode letters, digits, whitespace, _, ., /, =, +, and -.


<a id="nestedatt--throttle"></a>
### Nested Schema for `throttle`

Optional:
