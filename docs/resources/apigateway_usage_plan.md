# awscc_apigateway_usage_plan (Resource)

The ``AWS::ApiGateway::UsagePlan`` resource creates a usage plan for deployed APIs. A usage plan sets a target for the throttling and quota limits on individual client API keys. For more information, see [Creating and Using API Usage Plans in Amazon API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-api-usage-plans.html) in the *API Gateway Developer Guide*.
 In some cases clients can exceed the targets that you set. Don?t rely on usage plans to control costs. Consider using [](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-managing-costs.html) to monitor costs and [](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html) to manage API requests.

## Example Usage

### Usage Plan
Creates a usage plan for deployed APIs. A usage plan sets a target for the throttling and quota limits on individual client API keys.
```terraform
resource "awscc_apigateway_usage_plan" "example" {
  usage_plan_name = "Plan_dev"
  description     = "Dev usage plan"

  api_stages = [{
    api_id = awscc_apigateway_rest_api.example.id
    stage  = awscc_apigateway_stage.example.stage_name
  }]

  quota = {
    limit  = 20
    offset = 2
    period = "WEEK"
  }

  throttle = {
    burst_limit = 5
    rate_limit  = 10
  }
}

resource "awscc_apigateway_stage" "example" {
  rest_api_id   = awscc_apigateway_rest_api.example.id
  deployment_id = awscc_apigateway_deployment.example.deployment_id
  stage_name    = "dev"
}

resource "awscc_apigateway_deployment" "example" {
  description = "Example Deployment"
  rest_api_id = awscc_apigateway_rest_api.example.id
}

resource "awscc_apigateway_rest_api" "example" {
  body = jsonencode({
    openapi = "3.0.1"
    info = {
      title   = "example"
      version = "1.0"
    }
    paths = {
      "/example" = {
        get = {
          x-amazon-apigateway-integration = {
            httpMethod           = "GET"
            payloadFormatVersion = "1.0"
            type                 = "HTTP_PROXY"
            uri                  = "https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  })

  name = "example"

  endpoint_configuration = {
    types = ["REGIONAL"]
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `api_stages` (Attributes List) The associated API stages of a usage plan. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--api_stages))
- `description` (String) The description of a usage plan.
- `quota` (Attributes) The target maximum number of permitted requests per a given unit time interval. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--quota))
- `tags` (Attributes List) The collection of tags. Each tag element is associated with a given resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))
- `throttle` (Attributes) A map containing method level throttling information for API stage in a usage plan. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--throttle))
- `usage_plan_name` (String) The name of a usage plan.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `usage_plan_id` (String)

<a id="nestedatt--api_stages"></a>
### Nested Schema for `api_stages`

Optional:

- `api_id` (String) API Id of the associated API stage in a usage plan.
- `stage` (String) API stage name of the associated API stage in a usage plan.
- `throttle` (Attributes Map) Map containing method level throttling information for API stage in a usage plan. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--api_stages--throttle))

<a id="nestedatt--api_stages--throttle"></a>
### Nested Schema for `api_stages.throttle`

Optional:

- `burst_limit` (Number) The API target request burst rate limit. This allows more requests through for a period of time than the target rate limit.
- `rate_limit` (Number) The API target request rate limit.



<a id="nestedatt--quota"></a>
### Nested Schema for `quota`

Optional:

- `limit` (Number) The target maximum number of requests that can be made in a given time period.
- `offset` (Number) The number of requests subtracted from the given limit in the initial time period.
- `period` (String) The time period in which the limit applies. Valid values are "DAY", "WEEK" or "MONTH".


<a id="nestedatt--tags"></a>
### Nested Schema for `tags`

Required:

- `key` (String) The key name of the tag. You can specify a value that is 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length and cannot be prefixed with aws:. You can use any of the following characters: the set of Unicode letters, digits, whitespace, _, ., /, =, +, and -.
- `value` (String) The value for the tag. You can specify a value that is 0 to 256 Unicode characters in length and cannot be prefixed with aws:. You can use any of the following characters: the set of Unicode letters, digits, whitespace, _, ., /, =, +, and -.


<a id="nestedatt--throttle"></a>
### Nested Schema for `throttle`

Optional:

- `burst_limit` (Number) The API target request burst rate limit. This allows more requests through for a period of time than the target rate limit.
- `rate_limit` (Number) The API target request rate limit.
