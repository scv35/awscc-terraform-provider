# awscc_cloudwatch_alarm (Resource)

Resource Type definition for AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm

## Example Usage

### Alarm based on an Anomaly Detector

This example creates an alarm that is based on an anomaly detector.

```terraform
resource "awscc_cloudwatch_alarm" "lambda_invocations_alarm" {
  alarm_name = "LambdaInvocationsAlarm"
  comparison_operator = "LessThanLowerOrGreaterThanUpperThreshold"
  evaluation_periods = 1

  metrics = [{
    expression = "ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND(m1, 2)"
    id = "ad1"
  },
  {
    id = "m1"
    metric_stat = {
      metric = {
        metric_name = "Invocations"
        namespace = "AWS/Lambda"
      }
      period = 86400
      stat = "Sum"
    }
  }]

  threshold_metric_id = "ad1"
  treat_missing_data = "breaching"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `comparison_operator` (String) The arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified statistic and threshold.
- `evaluation_periods` (Number) The number of periods over which data is compared to the specified threshold.

### Optional

- `actions_enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether actions should be executed during any changes to the alarm state. The default is TRUE.
- `alarm_actions` (List of String) The list of actions to execute when this alarm transitions into an ALARM state from any other state.
- `alarm_description` (String) The description of the alarm.
- `alarm_name` (String) The name of the alarm.
- `datapoints_to_alarm` (Number) The number of datapoints that must be breaching to trigger the alarm.
- `dimensions` (Attributes List) The dimensions for the metric associated with the alarm. For an alarm based on a math expression, you can't specify Dimensions. Instead, you use Metrics. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--dimensions))
- `evaluate_low_sample_count_percentile` (String) Used only for alarms based on percentiles.
- `extended_statistic` (String) The percentile statistic for the metric associated with the alarm. Specify a value between p0.0 and p100.
- `insufficient_data_actions` (List of String) The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the INSUFFICIENT_DATA state from any other state.
- `metric_name` (String) The name of the metric associated with the alarm.
- `metrics` (Attributes List) An array that enables you to create an alarm based on the result of a metric math expression. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metrics))
- `namespace` (String) The namespace of the metric associated with the alarm.
- `ok_actions` (List of String) The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the OK state from any other state.
- `period` (Number) The period in seconds, over which the statistic is applied.
- `statistic` (String) The statistic for the metric associated with the alarm, other than percentile.
- `threshold` (Number) In an alarm based on an anomaly detection model, this is the ID of the ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND function used as the threshold for the alarm.
- `threshold_metric_id` (String) In an alarm based on an anomaly detection model, this is the ID of the ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND function used as the threshold for the alarm.
- `treat_missing_data` (String) Sets how this alarm is to handle missing data points. Valid values are breaching, notBreaching, ignore, and missing.
- `unit` (String) The unit of the metric associated with the alarm.

### Read-Only

- `arn` (String) Amazon Resource Name is a unique name for each resource.
- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.

### Nested Schema for `metrics`

Required:

- `id` (String) A short name used to tie this object to the results in the response.

Optional:

- `expression` (String) The math expression to be performed on the returned data.
- `label` (String) A human-readable label for this metric or expression.
- `metric_stat` (Attributes) The metric to be returned, along with statistics, period, and units. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metrics--metric_stat))
- `period` (Number) The period in seconds, over which the statistic is applied.
- `return_data` (Boolean) This option indicates whether to return the timestamps and raw data values of this metric.

- `period` (Number) The granularity, in seconds, of the returned data points.
- `stat` (String) The statistic to return.

Optional:

- `unit` (String) The unit to use for the returned data points.

<a id="nestedatt--metrics--metric_stat--metric"></a>
### Nested Schema for `metrics.metric_stat.metric`

Optional:

- `dimensions` (Attributes List) The dimensions for the metric. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--metrics--metric_stat--metric--dimensions))
