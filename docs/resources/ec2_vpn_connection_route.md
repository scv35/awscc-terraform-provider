# awscc_ec2_vpn_connection_route (Resource)

Specifies a static route for a VPN connection between an existing virtual private gateway and a VPN customer gateway. The static route allows traffic to be routed from the virtual private gateway to the VPN customer gateway.
 For more information, see [](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html) in the *User Guide*.

## Example Usage

### Create Static Route for VPN Connection

Demonstrates how to create a static route for an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection by specifying the destination CIDR block of the customer network and associating it with a VPN connection.

```terraform

data "aws_region" "current" {}

# VPC
resource "awscc_ec2_vpc" "example" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  tags = [{
    key   = "Name"
    value = "vpn-route-example"
  }]
}

# Virtual Private Gateway
resource "aws_vpn_gateway" "example" {
  vpc_id = awscc_ec2_vpc.example.vpc_id
  tags = {
    Name = "vpn-route-example"
  }
}

# Customer Gateway
