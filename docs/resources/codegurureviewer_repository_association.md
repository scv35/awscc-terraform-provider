# awscc_codegurureviewer_repository_association (Resource)

This resource schema represents the RepositoryAssociation resource in the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer service.

## Example Usage

### S3 as the repository to associate CodeGuru Reviewer with.  The bucket name must start with the prefix codeguru-reviewer-*

```terraform
resource "awscc_codegurureviewer_repository_association" "example2" {
  bucket_name = var.bucket_name
  name        = var.bucket_name
  type        = "S3Bucket"

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]

}

variable "bucket_name" {
  type = string
}
```

### CodeCommit as the repository to associate CodeGuru Reviewer with. Make sure to add a lifecycle rule to ignore the tag changes once CodeGuru Reviewer is associated with CodeCommit, if the repository was created with Terraform. 

```terraform
resource "awscc_codegurureviewer_repository_association" "example" {
  name = var.repo_name
  type = "CodeCommit"

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]

}

variable "repo_name" {
  type = string
}
```
