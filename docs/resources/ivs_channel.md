# awscc_ivs_channel (Resource)

Resource Type definition for AWS::IVS::Channel

## Example Usage

### Create Secure IVS Streaming Channel

Creates a low-latency, secure IVS channel with standard quality setting and authorized ingestion for live streaming purposes.
                                
Note: this example is generated by LLM using Amazon Bedrock and validated using terraform validate, apply and destroy. While we strive for accuracy and quality, please note that the information provided may not be entirely error-free or up-to-date. We recommend independently verifying the content.

```terraform
# AWS Region and Account ID
data "aws_region" "current" {}
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

# Example IVS Channel resource
resource "awscc_ivs_channel" "example" {
  name            = "demo-channel"
  type            = "STANDARD"
  latency_mode    = "LOW"
  authorized      = true
  insecure_ingest = false

  tags = [{
    key   = "Modified By"
    value = "AWSCC"
  }]
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `authorized` (Boolean) Whether the channel is authorized.
- `insecure_ingest` (Boolean) Whether the channel allows insecure ingest.
- `latency_mode` (String) Channel latency mode.
- `name` (String) Channel
- `preset` (String) Optional transcode preset for the channel. This is selectable only for ADVANCED_HD and ADVANCED_SD channel types. For those channel types, the default preset is HIGHER_BANDWIDTH_DELIVERY. For other channel types (BASIC and STANDARD), preset is the empty string ("").
- `recording_configuration_arn` (String) Recording Configuration ARN. A value other than an empty string indicates that recording is enabled. Default: "" (recording is disabled).
- `tags` (Attributes Set) A list of key-value pairs that contain metadata for the asset model. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--tags))
- `type` (String) Channel type, which determines the allowable resolution and bitrate. If you exceed the allowable resolution or bitrate, the stream probably will disconnect immediately.

### Read-Only

- `arn` (String) Channel ARN is automatically generated on creation and assigned as the unique identifier.
- `id` (String) Uniquely identifies the resource.
- `ingest_endpoint` (String) Channel ingest endpoint, part of the definition of an ingest server, used when you set up streaming software.
- `playback_url` (String) Channel Playback URL.
